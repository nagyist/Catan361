Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D terrain hex tiles suitable for an overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 
- due to popular demand, adapted to hex tiles from my set of painted square terrain tiles
- 6 biomes x 4 variations = 24 tiles total 
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees, hills, and mountains can overlap the tiles behind 

Terrain types included: 
- grassy plains 
- forest 
- water 
- desert dunes 
- marshland 
- snow-capped mountains

Do note that this does not actually require Unity 5.1.3 or higher - this is a tilesheet saved as a png and split and named into sprites. There are also the individual tiles in a separate folder if that's how you roll.

Usage:
These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further tiles to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. I do have a passion for terrain tiles, after all! So drop me a line if you've got something particular in mind.
